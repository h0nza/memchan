		Memory Channels in Tcl
		(Version 1.0 / NoRemember 15, 1996)

		Andreas Kupries	(a.kupries@westend.com)

This directory contains a freely distributable extension to Tcl
implementing memory channels, i.e. channels storing the data
placed into them in memory, not on disk.


BACKGROUND

Tcl stands for the Tool Command Language, a freely distributable,
embeddable scripting language package.  Tk is an freely distributable X
windows interface toolkit and widget library implemented as a collection of
new commands added to Tcl.

Memchan is developed for Tcl 7.5 or higher.  It is a pure Tcl extension,
Tk is not required.

This distribution contains the source code for Memchan + (very simple)
documentation describing the new command.
Memchan should be available by anonymous ftp from ftp.neosoft.com in
the /tcl/extension directory (at least after their reorganization).

Primary ftp-site will be <ftp://ftp.kisters.de/pub/lang/tcl/memchan1.0.tar.gz>

To compile Memchan follow the instructions of the INSTALL file.

REMARKS

This extension was developed on my private computer, a PC running
Linux 1.2.13. It is not tested anywhere else. Feedback is appreciated.
