Installation and compilation instructions
with regard to the Memchan extension to TCL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o	This extension requires plain tcl, version 7.5 or
	higher.  If you don't have it installed, do this now.
	The configure script will check the version of the
	installed tcl!


o	That you are reading this text means, that you extracted
	the gzipped tar-archive in a directory of your choice.
	This operation should have created a subdirectory with
	the name 'memchan<version>'.  It is refered to as
	"source-directory" from now on.


o	'cd' into the source-directory, e.g. make it your working
	directory, then start the automatic setup by typing
	'configure'.  If your system does not understand the
	'#!' notation of specifying script-interpreters, you
	have to type 'sh configure' (or '/bin/sh configure', ...).

o	The configure script searches for tcl.h in the following
	places:

	-1	$(TCL_INCLUDE_DIR)
	-2	$(prefix)
	-3	/usr/local/include
	-4	/usr/include
	-5	../tcl7.5/generic
	-6	../tcl/generic
	-7	../tcl

	By default $(TCL_INCLUDE_DIR) is empty and $(prefix) points
	to the location of an installed 'tclsh' or is /usr/local if
	tclsh could not be found via $PATH.

	Use the following options to overide the defaults:

		--prefix=DIR		   -> $(prefix)=DIR
		--with-tcl=DIR		   -> $(TCL_INCLUDE_DIR)=DIR/include
		--with-tcl-include-dir=DIR -> $(TCL_INCLUDE_DIR)=DIR


o	To find libtcl.a (libtcl.so.??) the paths

	-1	$(TCL_LIB_DIR)
	-2	$(exec_prefix)
	-3	/usr/local/include
	-4	/usr/include
	-5	../tcl7.5/unix
	-6	../tcl/unix
	-7	../tcl

	are searched. $(TCL_LIB_DIR) is empty by default, but
	can be set via --with-tcl or --with-tcl-lib-dir.

		--with-tcl=DIR		-> $(TCL_LIB_DIR)=DIR/lib
		--with-tcl-lib-dir=DIR	-> $(TCL_LIB_DIR)=DIR

	$(exec_prefix) contains the same value as $(prefix) by
	default, but can be set explicitly via --exec-prefix


o	Another notable configure option is --enable-shared whose
	appearance commands the script to configure the Makefile
	for creation of shared libraries (as required for dynamic
	loading).


o	Now start the compilation by typing 'make'.
	The makefile will then compile the sources and build the
	library.

o	At last type 'make install' to install the generated
	library.
