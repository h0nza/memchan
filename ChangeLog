	* memchan.c: Started to work on the changes required by 8.1 and
	  the stubs. 

	* configure.in (TCL_LIB/INCLUDE_DIR): Added 8.0.4 and 8.0.5 to the
	  list of paths to search.

Sun Dec 20 19:54:08 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* memchan.c: Changed definition of panic to allow co-existence
	  with tcl8.0.4+. Got information about problems from a
	  beta-tester of the new plus-patches.

Wed Sep 30 15:43:42 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* configure.in (TCL_LIB/INCLUDE_DIR): Added some additional
	  intelligence: Setting one of the variables, but not the other
	  causes automatic definition of the missing part with a value
	  derived from the defined directory. Suggested by Larry Virden.
	  Added 8.0.3 to the paths to search. Added $exec_prefix/lib to
	  the paths to search for the tcl-library.

	* configure.in: Fixed a bug noted by David Herron
	  <davidh@crl.com>. From its mail:

	> In the section that checks for the TCL library there
	> is a loop looking for different library extensions.
	> In my case it needs to match the ".so.*" case of
	> the loop, but it doesn't.
	> 
	> Changing the test to read as follows fixes the problem.
	> 
	>    if test -f $dir/libtcl$version$libsuff; then
	>        memchan_cv_lib_TCL_LIB="-L$dir -ltcl$version"
	>        TCL_LIB_DIR="$dir"
	>    fi
	> 
	> The difference is removal of the quote marks around
	> the file name.  This allows the "*" to be evaluated
	> by the shell & find the file name.
	> 
	> Another change that would be convenient is, in
	> the 'for version in ...' part, to add "80" to
	> the list of choices.  With (at least) tcl8.0pl2
	> on FreeBSD the library is "libtcl80.so.1.0" and 
	> since the configure script only looks for "libtcl8.0"
	> it is not found again because of that.

Sat Jun 13 14:27:10 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* memchan.c (channelType): Updated to reflect structure change
	  from Tcl 8.0 to Tcl 8.1.

Sun Jul  6 14:29:51 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* -------------------- 1.4 released --------
	
	* memchan.c: Updated code to reflect changes in Set/GetOption API
	  of channel drivers made by 8.0b2.

Thu May 29 11:25:56 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* -------------------- 1.3 released --------
	
	* memchan.c: Bag of changes to accomodate this code to the new
	  notifier system of 8.0b1. Will now run either with 7.6 or
	  8.0b1. The decision is made at compile time.

	* PREPARE: adapted to new 'makedist' and interface.

Thu Feb 27 21:49:48 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* memchan.c (Mem_safeInit): renamed to 'Memchan_SafeInit'. First
	  bug in this 1.2 Release.

	* -------------------- 1.2 released --------
	
Tue Feb 18 18:35:59 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* -------------------- 1.2 ready for release --------

Mon Feb 17 17:47:22 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* memchan.c: added prototypes missed by MSVC++.

Sat Feb 15 20:09:58 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* memchan.c: integrated changes required to compile cleanly on
	  windows. 

	* INSTALL: updated to contain info for compilation on Windows as
	  well. 

	* Added 'makefile.vc' for compilation on Windows. The required
	  'pkgIndex.win' is generated by 'PREPARE' from 'pkgIndex.tcl.in'.

	* Rewrote generation of distribution (PREPARE, make-tape).
	  'DESCRIPTION' now central point for version information. The
	  data obtained there is placed into all relevant files at
	  distribution time (README, LSM, ...),

	  Note: 'PREPARE' is an file internal to the package. It contains
	  tcl-code preparing the package for distribution (removing
	  inofficial and/or internal files, manpage generation, ...). It
	  is not part of the distribution however.

Mon Jan 13 22:21:48 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* INSTALL: updated to reflect new search order and versions.

	* Makefile.in: Removed now superfluous variables.

	* configure.in: don't use -lsocket, -lm. Why there they included
	  anyway ?

	* configure.in (line 259): don't bother with -ltclX.Y if not
	  running under AIX.

	* configure.in: lowest possible tcl version is 7.6, not 7.5. Added
	  recognition of 8.0 versions.

	* configure.in: changed search order: sibling directories before
	  <prefix> paths. But commandline options overide all.

Thu Dec  5 19:02:06 1996  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* PREPARE: updated to exclude the new directories (see below) from
	  distribution.

	* added internal directories 'patches' and 'mails'.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): adapted to last change, done by patch,
	  see below.

	* pkgIndex.tcl.in: former pkgIndex.in, renamed by patch, see below.

	* Makefile.in (LIB_RUNTIME_DIR): added by patch, see below.

	* got a patch from Jan Nijtmans <nijtmans@nici.kun.nl>.

Fri Nov 15 22:45:04 1996  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* Extracted memory channel code from trans-patch and made it a
	  separate library.
