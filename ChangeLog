	  creation of null channels.

	* generic/null.c: New channel type, the null device.

	  target. Mailed problem and fix to TEA mailing list.

Sat Sep 18 15:06:07 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/fifo.c (GetOption): See below, '-allocated'.

	* generic/memchan.c (MemchanCmd): Added option '-initial-size',
	  proposed by <Petteri.Kettunen@picker.fi>. If specified the
	  channel will preallocate some buffer space, making the first
	  write accesses a bit faster.
	  (GetOption): Added '-allocated' to query the size of the
	  allocated buffers, not the used number of bytes.

Tue Sep 14 00:42:11 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/memchan.c, fifo.c, counter.c: Changed to use LTOA
	  instead of 'sprintf'.

	* generic/memchanInt.h (LTOA): Added definition of LTOA macro,
	  its contents are dependent on the presence of 'ltoa'. The system
	  uses 'sprintf' as its fallback.

	* win/makefile.vc(5),.gnu, unix/configure/in, tea/configure.in:
	  Added check for 'ltoa', Windows assumes that the function is
	  present.

	* generic/memchanInt.h: Added a fix sent by Jan to enable use with
	  gcc-2.95 on Windows.

	* BUILD_memchan changed to BUILD_Memchan, adapted the header and
	  the other build directories. Have to use ./ to load the library
	  for testing. This obsoletes LD_LIBRARY_PATH and consorts.

	* Added 'tea' build directory the day before yesterday and asked
	  for problem reports (Jan, Larry). These came in yesterday.

Sun Aug  1 16:15:23 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Added binary distribution for Windows, from Jan, excluded old
 	  binary distributions (for 1.9) and added a reference to the old
 	  site for this version instead.

Tue Jul 27 22:57:56 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* doc/nodes/home.node, compile.node, win.node, mac.node,
	  unix.node: Moved doc/INSTALL to HTML. Added reference to version
	  1.9 site for people interested in usability with Tcl 7.6.

	* generic/memchan.c, counter.c, init.c, fifo.c, memchanInt.h:
	  Removed all #ifdefs relating to Tcl 7.6, support for that
	  version is no dropped.

Mon Jun 28 23:17:35 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* unix/configure.in, Makefile.in: Matt Newman <matt@novadigm.com>
	  sent in some changes to built the extension on HPUX (Basically
	  check for .sl extension too).

Sat Jun 12 23:12:26 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* win/makefile.vc5 (MCOBJS): See below.

	* win/makefile.vc (MCOBJS): Added 'dllEntry.obj' to the
	  definition. 

	* generic/memchanInt.h: 'DllEntryPoint' removed. See below.

	* generic/init.c: 'DllEntryPoint' removed. See below.

	* win/dllEntry.c: New file, again from Jan, to simplify DLL
	  generation for Windows. The information in it can be removed
	  from the generic parts.

Fri Jun 11 22:40:02 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* win/Makefile.gnu: Got from Jan <nijtmans@wxs.nl> a binary
 	  distribution for memchan, compiled with Cygwin B20.1
 	  (-mno-cygwin), and the Makefile used to do that. Assorted
	  little changes to 'mc.rc' too.

Wed May 26 00:17:18 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* tests/fifo.test: Added test suite for 'fifo's.

	* unix/pkgIndex.tcl: Added new command to the index.

	* doc/nodes/cmds.node: Added documentation for 'fifo'.

	* generic/fifo.c: New file, new channel type. Like memchan in
	  memory, but access is done fifo-like (first in/first
	  out). Seeking is not possible. Like a socket or a pipe, but in
	  memory.

Tue May 25 18:35:24 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/memchanInt.h: Made the header usable for C++ compilers.

	* unix/Makefile.in: See below.

	* win/makefile.vc(5): Added rules for new object files.

	* generic/counter.c: Moved handle generation into separate
	  file. Added usage of mutexes for thread enabled tcl to make
	  handle generation safe.

	* generic/memchan.c: Moved declarations and initialization code
	  into separate files (memchanInt.h, init.c).

	* doc/nodes/cmds.node: Added description of the provided command.

Tue May 11 22:29:18 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* ---------------- Ready to release 1.8 --------------------
	
	* unix/Makefile.in, PREPARE, tests: Added testsuite to memchan.

Mon Apr 12 17:27:08 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/memchan.c: Fixed error in definition of EXPORT, as
	  reported by <Petteri.Kettunen@picker.fi>.

	* win/makefile.vc(5): Fixed some errors in the win makefiles, as
	  reported by <Petteri.Kettunen@picker.fi>.

Thu Mar 25 12:30:40 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* ---------------- Ready to release 1.7 --------------------

Wed Mar 24 13:15:36 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* win/pkgIndex.tcl: Separate package index, no way to use one DLL
	  for all versions of tcl. Stubs no help ?

	* unix/configure.in, unix/Makefile.in: Added all necessary code to
	  detect and use stubs appropriately.

	* unix/pkgIndex.tcl.in: Added code to check package dependency on
	  tcl version, which is dependent on the usage of stubs too.

Mon Mar 22 09:57:05 1999  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* memchan.c: Started to work on the changes required by 8.1 and
	  the new stub-mechanism.

	* configure.in (TCL_LIB/INCLUDE_DIR): Added 8.0.4 and 8.0.5 to the
	  list of paths to search.

Sun Dec 20 19:54:08 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* memchan.c: Changed definition of panic to allow co-existence
	  with tcl8.0.4+. Got information about problems from a
	  beta-tester of the new plus-patches.

Wed Sep 30 15:43:42 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* configure.in (TCL_LIB/INCLUDE_DIR): Added some additional
	  intelligence: Setting one of the variables, but not the other
	  causes automatic definition of the missing part with a value
	  derived from the defined directory. Suggested by Larry Virden.
	  Added 8.0.3 to the paths to search. Added $exec_prefix/lib to
	  the paths to search for the tcl-library.

Fri Jun 19 22:59:18 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* configure.in: Fixed a bug noted by David Herron
	  <davidh@crl.com>. From its mail:

	> In the section that checks for the TCL library there
	> is a loop looking for different library extensions.
	> In my case it needs to match the ".so.*" case of
	> the loop, but it doesn't.
	> 
	> Changing the test to read as follows fixes the problem.
	> 
	>    if test -f $dir/libtcl$version$libsuff; then
	>        memchan_cv_lib_TCL_LIB="-L$dir -ltcl$version"
	>        TCL_LIB_DIR="$dir"
	>    fi
	> 
	> The difference is removal of the quote marks around
	> the file name.  This allows the "*" to be evaluated
	> by the shell & find the file name.
	> 
	> Another change that would be convenient is, in
	> the 'for version in ...' part, to add "80" to
	> the list of choices.  With (at least) tcl8.0pl2
	> on FreeBSD the library is "libtcl80.so.1.0" and 
	> since the configure script only looks for "libtcl8.0"
	> it is not found again because of that.

Sat Jun 13 14:27:10 1998  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* memchan.c (channelType): Updated to reflect structure change
	  from Tcl 8.0 to Tcl 8.1.

Sun Jul  6 14:29:51 1997  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* -------------------- 1.4 released --------
	
	* memchan.c: Updated code to reflect changes in Set/GetOption API
	  of channel drivers made by 8.0b2.

Thu May 29 11:25:56 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* -------------------- 1.3 released --------
	
	* memchan.c: Bag of changes to adapt this code to the new
	  notifier system of 8.0b1. Will now run either with 7.6 or
	  8.0b1. The decision is made at compile time.

	* PREPARE: adapted to new 'makedist' and interface.

Thu Feb 27 21:49:48 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* memchan.c (Mem_safeInit): renamed to 'Memchan_SafeInit'. First
	  bug in this 1.2 Release.

	* -------------------- 1.2 released --------
	
Tue Feb 18 18:35:59 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* -------------------- 1.2 ready for release --------

Mon Feb 17 17:47:22 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* memchan.c: added prototypes missed by MSVC++.

Sat Feb 15 20:09:58 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* memchan.c: integrated changes required to compile cleanly on
	  windows. 

	* INSTALL: updated to contain info for compilation on Windows as
	  well. 

	* Added 'makefile.vc' for compilation on Windows. The required
	  'pkgIndex.win' is generated by 'PREPARE' from 'pkgIndex.tcl.in'.

	* Rewrote generation of distribution (PREPARE, make-tape).
	  'DESCRIPTION' now central point for version information. The
	  data obtained from it is placed into all relevant files at
	  distribution time (README, LSM, ...),

	  Note: 'PREPARE' is an file internal to the package. It contains
	  tcl-code preparing the package for distribution (removing
	  unofficial and/or internal files, manpage generation, ...). It
	  is not part of the distribution however.

Mon Jan 13 22:21:48 1997  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* INSTALL: updated to reflect new search order and versions.

	* Makefile.in: Removed now superfluous variables.

	* configure.in: don't use -lsocket, -lm. Why there they included
	  anyway ?

	* configure.in (line 259): don't bother with -ltclX.Y if not
	  running under AIX.

	* configure.in: lowest possible tcl version is 7.6, not 7.5. Added
	  recognition of 8.0 versions.

	* configure.in: changed search order: sibling directories before
	  <prefix> paths. But commandline options overide all.

Thu Dec  5 19:02:06 1996  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* PREPARE: updated to exclude the new directories (see below) from
	  distribution.

	* added internal directories 'patches' and 'mails'.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): adapted to last change, done by patch,
	  see below.

	* pkgIndex.tcl.in: former pkgIndex.in, renamed by patch, see below.

	* Makefile.in (LIB_RUNTIME_DIR): added by patch, see below.

	* got a patch from Jan Nijtmans <nijtmans@nici.kun.nl>.

Fri Nov 15 22:45:04 1996  Andreas Kupries  <aku@bluepeak.westend.com>

	* Extracted memory channel code from trans-patch and made it a
	  separate library.
