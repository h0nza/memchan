	* INSTALL: updated to reflect new search order and versions.

	* Makefile.in: Removed now superfluous variables.

	* configure.in: don't use -lsocket, -lm. Why there they included
	  anyway ?

	* configure.in (line 259): don't bother with -ltclX.Y if not
	  running under AIX.

	* configure.in: lowest possible tcl version is 7.6, not 7.5. Added
	  recognition of 8.0 versions.

	* configure.in: changed search order: sibling directories before
	  <prefix> paths. But commandline options overide all.

	* PREPARE: updated to exclude the new directories (see below) from
	  distribution.

	* added internal directories 'patches' and 'mails'.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): adapted to last change, done by patch,
	  see below.

	* pkgIndex.tcl.in: former pkgIndex.in, renamed by patch, see below.

	* Makefile.in (LIB_RUNTIME_DIR): added by patch, see below.

	* got a patch from Jan Nijtmans <nijtmans@nici.kun.nl>.
