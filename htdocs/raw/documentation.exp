[p] Currently only the [mem/txt/old/2] carries documentation.

[p] When the manpages and/or TMML documentation are written they will
be integrated into this site using some automated conversion to keep
the raw documentation and the web in sync.

[p] For the people interested in internal details, here is the [mem/clog].
