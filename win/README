This is the README file for the Windows version of the Memchan extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile Memchan for Windows, you need the following items:

	Memchan @mFullVersion@ Source Distribution
	Tcl 7.6, 8.0* Source or binary distribution

	Visual C++ 2.x/4.x/5.x

In the "win" subdirectory of the source release you will find a file
called "makefile.vc".  This is the makefile for the Visual C++ compiler.
You should copy it to "makefile" and update the paths at the top of the
file to reflect your system configuration.  Now you can use "nmake" to
build the memchan dll.
